A little bit on balancing

There are 2 ways to balance a tree. Most common method is tree rotation:



An AVL Trees means a self-balancing search trees. If balance gets out of range −1…+1, 
the subtree is rotated to bring into balance.

Second way is to convert tree into a linkedlist, then build the tree again (we have 
discussed this algorithm before, pick the middle element).

This method is slow if we insert and re-balance on each step, but we can do bulk insert/delete 
forgetting about the re-balancing for a while. This will make the data structure faster! more details
